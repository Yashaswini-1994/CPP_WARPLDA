# DataProvenance.LDA-GA
Version of the LDA-GA algorithm for data provenance in C++

## Requirements
- NVIDA GPU
- CUDA installation & nvcc
- lnuma library
- gcc

## Building
1. Edit the Makefile to reflect the CUDA capability of your machine. (You can find this information running the CUDA deviceQuery sample) If the capability of you machine is 3.7 for example, you should change the line `GPU_ARCH_FLAG   = arch=compute_70,code=sm_70` to `GPU_ARCH_FLAG   = arch=compute_37,code=sm_37` 

2. Run the `build.sh` script to build the solution and its dependencies. If the build succeeds the `provenance` executable will be created

3. Use the `make` command to recompile files after any change


## Running
To run the project for a specific population size and fitness threshold, use the following command:
```
./provenance config.json 
```

To test the performance of the LDA algorithm testing different number of itterations and topics, use the following commang
```
./provenance -metrics
```
